<p> 

There is no need that your android mobile has to be rooted to flash a custom recovery.You have only to choose the custom recovery ,download it to your pc and flash the new rom.


</p>











<p>
 you can search in google and in the web sites like XDA 
Developers for : how to unlock the bootloader of your 
specific phone, which recovery you should use (usually <a href="http://teamw.in/project/twrp2" target="_blank">TWRP</a> or
 <a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager" target="_blank">ClockworkMod</a>), and how to flash it.</p>










<p>Your phone will be wiped while you unlock the bootloader , and without root access, you won't be able to back up very much. So,
 save the data you need in your computer&#8212;you will have to set up your phone from scratch just this once before continuing.</p>

<p>flashing your ROM. First, you need to find the ROM you want.You can search in google or use theses links: 
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/this-database-of-android-roms-helps-you-choose-the-best-1449794780">
this chart is a good place to start</a>, as is <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5915093/five-best-android-roms">list of the five most popular</a>. Youca see <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com" target="_blank">
XDA Developers forums</a> to see what's available for your particular phone.</p>











<p>download the rom that you have found,using wifi and save it to your pc. It should come like ZIP file.You can download it 
from your computer and transfer 
it via USB or download it to the sd card.</p>











<p>To flash your ROM:</p>











<ol><li>Reboot your phone into Recovery mode.</li><li>Head "Install" or "Install ZIP from SD Card" section</li><li>
select the ZIP file you downloaded</li><li>Wait for the process to finish.</li><li>
 you may also need to wipe your data 
and/or cache. In TWRP, you found it in "Wipe" section,in
 ClockworkMod,choose the "Wipe Data/Factory 
Reset" option or the "Wipe Cache Partition" option. When you're done, 
reboot into your new ROM.</li></ol>











<p>wipe your data and cache?</p>











<ul><li>If you flash a ROM different than the one you're currently 
running, you should wipe data and cache.This performs a 
factory reset on your phone, and will lose all your data.</li><li>if you want to
flash a new version of a ROM you're already running, we 
recommend wiping your data and cache&#8212;but sufficient
 with wiping only the cache.</li></ul>














<p>When you reboot, you should be in your new ROM, 
ready to use it! But what? There's no Play Store?</p>











<h3>Download and Flash Google Apps</h3>

<p>Google's apps are not open source, custom ROMs can't have Google's 
apps&#8212;like Gmail, Hangouts, or the Play Store&#8212;with their ROMs. That 
means you'll need to download and flash them separately.You ca use this link <a href="http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Google_Apps" target="_blank">this page on RootzWiki</a> 
to find out which ZIP file you need, download it to your phone, and flash it just like you did the ROM in step three.you ca use this link from this web site : www.lifehacker.com
