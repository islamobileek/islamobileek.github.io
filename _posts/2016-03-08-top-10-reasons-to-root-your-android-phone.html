<p>Android isn't open enough to give you some of the features you want. 
 
  
 Power up your hardware,get features like Beats Audio from other phones, or 
 emulate exclusive features like those on the Moto X.Whatever you want,rooting your phone gives you the power to do a lot more.</p>













 






























<h3>9. Automate Everything</h3>












<p ><img class="img-responsive" src="http://i.imgur.com/JksnphP.jpg"   alt="Android Phone"></p>












<p>probably You've heard of Tasker, the app that 

automates just about anything on your phone. You don't need to root your phone to use it, but if you're rooted,
 it can do a whole lot more. Certain tasks, like toggling 3G, GPS, changing CPU speed, turning the screen on, 
 and others require root access. So, if you want to get the full benefit of an app like Tasker, 
 you'll definitely want to root your phone.</p>

<p> with root&#8212;as always&#8212;you have even more power. For example, with
an app like SetCPU you can overclock your phone for better performance, or underclock it for better battery life. You can also use 
With this app : Greenify :
You automatically hibernate apps you aren't using&#8212;perfect for those apps that always want to run in the background when you're not looking.</p>















 






























<h3>7. Block Ads in Any App</h3>












<p ><img class="http://i.imgur.com/XpCQoRe.jpg"   alt="Top 10 Reasons to Root Your Android Phone"></p>












<p>We understand the need for occasional ads&#8212;which is a menner to make money.
 If you want to block ads in certain apps or on certain devices,
 rooting is by far the best way to do so. <a href="http://adfree.bigtincan.com/" target="_blank">AdFree</a>, 
 <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/android-about" target="_blank">AdBlock Plus</a>, 
 and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ad-away/" target="_blank">Ad Away</a> 
 are all great options, if you aren't rooted,

<h3>6. Back Up Your Phone</h3>
























<p>You can back up your apps and settings first when you restor you device or you have a new device. That way, you can
 get your entire setup back in just a few taps.you can back up apps and data,If you aren't rooted,
 but you won't necessarily be able to backup system apps and their data, or automate the entire process as well as Titanium Backup can. 











 






























<h3>5. Remove Preinstalled Crapware</h3>















<p>Titanium Backup can also uninstall that annoying, battery-draining, space-wasting crapware that
 comes preinstalled on so many phones these days&#8212;and, bur you need to have,
 root.

<h3>4. Tweak the Dark Corners of Android</h3>

























<p>
rooting gives you the power to tweak just about any thinhg you can think of

 Whether you want to customize your keyboard layout with something like Keyboard Manager or give yourself faster scrolling, improved multitasking, and extra themes with 
 Pimp My ROM, 
 rooting gives you the power to tweak just about any corner you can think of. If you want to do it, chances are someone over on a forum
 like XDA has created a mini-app or tweak that will help.</p>













 






























<h3>3. Flash a Custom Kernel</h3>

























<p>Some of Android's tweaks require a custom rom, which you can only flash with a rooted device. The kernel is responsible for helping your apps communicate with the hardware of your phone, which means a custom kernel can give you better performance, battery life, and even extra features like Wi-Fi tethering (on unsupported phones), faster battery charging, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5881842/how-to-get-better-battery-life-and-performance-on-your-android-phone-with-a-new-kernel">lots more</a>. You can flash kernels manually or simplify the process with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5793257/kernel-manager-makes-installing-custom-android-kernels-a-snap">something like Kernel Manager</a>.</p><p >Advertisement</p>

<h3>2. Flash a Custom ROM</h3>

























<p>A custom ROM is a custom version of Android, and it
 
 truly changes how you use your phone. Some merely bring a stock version of Android to non-stock phones, 
 or later versions of Android to phones that don't have it yet. 
 <a href="http://lifehacker.com/cyanogenmod-10-1-stable-brings-jelly-bean-to-a-ton-of-a-566788027">Some add a few handy features</a>,
 <a href="http://lifehacker.com/paranoid-android-brings-chat-head-style-multitasking-to-496388053">some add lots of really unique features</a>,
 and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5795542/miui-is-a-gorgeous-super-fast-rom-for-android">some change your operating system from head to toe</a>. 
 No matter what phone you have&#8212;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5980201/are-roms-really-necessary-on-a-nexus-phone">even if it's a Nexus</a>
 &#8212;we highly recommend checking out the custom ROMs out there. You won't be disappointed. Note: As some of you have noted, you don't actually 
 need root access to flash a custom ROM&#8212;though you will need to unlock your bootloader (a process that sometimes comes bundled with root 
 access). Still, it requires freeing your device from manufacturer lockdowns, so we've kept it in the list despite this technicality!</p>













 






























<h3>1. Truly you Own Your Device</h3>
























<p>All of this means that: you own your device, and you should be able to do with it as you please. Certain manufacturers and carriers try to keep that from happening, but with root access, you truly own your device and open yourself up to all the possibilities other parties try to block. Sure, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5853519/how-do-i-fix-my-bricked-android-phone">there's some risk involved</a>, and we <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5895234/is-it-a-good-idea-to-root-or-jailbreak-my-friends-phone">don't usually recommend rooting other people's phones</a>, but in the end, you can't put a price on true openness and control.
