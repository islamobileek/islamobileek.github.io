<p>Some apps require root access.&#160;
it is nesesary to have root if you want to run certain apps.

&#160;Here&#8217;s a metod for rooting your device.</p>

<p id="div-thetop1">
 
 

 
</p>
<h3>What Is Root?</h3>
<p>Root user is to have access to the entire operating system, and do what you want. By default,
 you don&#8217;t have root access, and certain apps won&#8217;t function without root access. </p>
<p>Rooting&#8221; is the act of gaining access to the root user account. </a>.</p>
<p> With root, you can remove bloatware, run a firewall, enable&#160;tethering even if your carrier is blocking it, manually back up your system, 

and use other tweaks 
that require low-level system access.</p>
<p>Some&#160;apps have features that only work on a rooted device.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive"  alt="" src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></p>
<h3>Warnings</h3>
<p>Android devices don&#8217;t come rooted
 for a reason. In fact, some&#160;device manufacturers go out of their way to prevent you from rooting. Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong>. Apps could abuse root privileges you&#8217;ve granted and snoop on other apps, something which isn&#8217;t normally

 possible. In fact, Google 
 
 prevents you from using Android Pay&#160;on rooted devices for this reason.</li>
<li><strong>Warranty</strong>: Some manufacturers assert that 
rooting voids your device&#8217;s warranty

. However, rooting will not actually damage your hardware. In many cases, you&#160;can &#8220;unroot&#8221; your device
 and manufacturers won&#8217;t be able to tell if it&#8217;s been rooted.</li>
<li><strong>Bricking</strong>you do this at your own risk. Rooting in general is a very safe process. 
If you mess something up, you can&#8217;t just expect free warranty service to fix it. If you&#8217;re worried, do a bit of research first 
and see if other people report success rooting your device with the tool you&#8217;re planning on using.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Many Ways to Root an Android Phone</h3>
<p><img class="img-responsive"  alt="htcunlock"   src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></p>
<p>There are many ways to root an Android phone</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock the Bootloader</strong>: Google and device manufacturers don&#8217;t officially support rooting, but they do provide an 
official way to gain low-level access to some devices, which then allows you to root. Tools like the 
Nexus Root Toolkit for Nexus devices automate 
this process. Other manufacturers also offer ways to unlock the bootloader, but only for certain devices.</li>
<li><strong>Exploit a Security Vulnerability</strong>: Other&#160;devices are locked down. Their manufacturers provide no official way to unlock 
their bootloaders and tamper with their software. These devices can still be rooted, but only by discovering a security vulnerability on the device

 and exploiting it to install a su binary onto their system partition.</li>
<li><strong>Flash CyanogenMod or Another Custom ROM</strong>: Technically, this is an extension of one of the above methods. Unlocking the
 bootloader and exploiting a security vulnerability can each&#160;allow you to flash&#160;
 Custom ROMs like CyanogenMod,
 
 which often come pre-rooted. CyanogenMod includes a simple toggle on its settings screen that allows you to enable or disable root access.
 Upgrading to a new version of CyanogenMod or your custom ROM won&#8217;t unroot your device if the ROM comes with an integrated way to enable root.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, we&#8217; ll primarily be discussing users who have an unlockable bootloader. If your phone requires an exploit, we won&#8217;t

 be able to help you, since the process is different for just about every phone. You&#8217;ll have to search&#160;a forum like 
 <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA Developers</a>&#160;for more information on how to root your specific device.&#160;
 This guide previously featured one-click root apps <a href="https://www.kingoapp.com/">Kingo Root</a> and <a href="https://towelroot.com/">
 Towelroot</a>, and those may still support some older phones&#160;as well.</p>
<p>If your device does have an unlockable bootloader, however, then read on. We generally recommend the TWRP method over one-click root 
programs because you learn exactly how everything works, which will help you troubleshoot if something goes wrong in the future&#8211;
one-click root programs aren&#8217;t as transparent. Before you begin this&#160;process, you&#8217;ll need to&#160;
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/239798/how-to-unlock-your-android-phones-bootloader-the-official-way/">unlock your bootloader the official way</a>
, and then&#160;<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/240047/how-to-flash-twrp-recovery-on-your-android-phone">
install the TWRP recovery environment using these instructions</a>. We&#8217;ll then use TWRP to root your phone.</p>
<h3>How to Flash SuperSU to Your Phone and Gain Root Access</h3>
<p>Alright, so you&#8217;ve unlocked your bootloader, and you&#8217;ve installed&#160;TWRP. Great! You&#8217;re actually almost there. 
To gain root access, we&#8217;re going to use a program called <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1538053">SuperSU</a>,
which gives you the ability to grant root access to other apps.</p>
<p>SuperSU is available in the Google Play Store, but that version doesn&#8217;t actually give you root access&#8211;in fact, you need root access

 to use it in the first place! Talk about a Catch-22. Thankfully,&#160;SuperSU is also available as a .zip&#160;file that 
 we can &#8220;flash&#8221; with TWRP. Doing so will grant you root access along with the management features of SuperSU&#8217;s Android app.</p>
 
<p>So, to start, head to <a href="https://download.chainfire.eu/supersu">this link</a>, which will take you to the latest version of SuperSU 
available for download. Download the .zip&#160;file to your computer, plug in your phone with a USB cable, and drag the SuperSU zip&#160;to your 
phone&#8217;s internal storage or SD card.</p>
<p>Next, reboot your phone into TWRP recovery.&#160;Doing this is&#160;a bit different on every phone&#8211;for example, you may have to hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously, then use the volume keys to boot &#8220;Recovery Mode&#8221;. Google instructions for your specific model to see how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve done so, you&#8217;ll be greeted with the familiar TWRP home screen. Click the Install&#160;button.</p>
<p>NOTE: You should probably&#160; make a backup in TWRP before continuing with this process.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1-twrp-install.png"><img class="img-responsive"  alt="1-twrp-install"   src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></a></p>
<p>The following screen will appear. Scroll down and navigate to the SuperSU ZIP file you transferred earlier.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-choose-zip.png"><img class="img-responsive"  alt="2-choose-zip"   src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></a></p>
<p>Tap the SuperSU zip and you&#8217;ll see this screen. Swipe to confirm the flash.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3-confirm-flash.png"><img class="img-responsive"  alt="3-confirm-flash"   src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></a></p>
<p>It should only take a moment to flash the SuperSU package.&#160; When it finishes, tap the &#8220;Wipe cache/Dalvik&#8221; button that appears and swipe to confirm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-wipe-cache.png"><img class="img-responsive"  alt="4-wipe-cache"   src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></a></p>
<p>When that finishes, tap the &#8220;Reboot System&#8221; button to boot back into Android.</p>
<p>If&#160;TWRP asks if you want to install SuperSU now, choose &#8220;Do Not Install&#8221;. Sometimes, TWRP can&#8217;t detect that you already have SuperSU, so it&#8217;ll ask to flash its built-in version. But it&#8217;s almost always best to flash the latest version of SuperSU yourself, which we&#8217;ve just done.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TWRP-root.png"><img class="img-responsive"  alt="TWRP-root"   src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></a></p>
<h3>Managing Root Permissions With the SuperSU App</h3>
<p>When you restart your mobile, you should see the new SuperSU icon in your app drawer.&#160;SuperSU&#160;controls&#160;which other apps on your phone get root permissions. Whenever an app wants to request root permissions, it has to ask your SuperSU app, which will show a request prompt.</p>
<p>To make sure root is working properly, you can download the Root Checker app and verify your rooted status. Alternatively, download a root-only app you&#8217;ve been wanting to try,&#160;and see if it asks you for superuser permissions.</p>
<p>For example, if we open and try to add an app to&#160 , Greenify &#8211;a handy battery-saving app for rooted phones&#8211;we&#8217;ll see this popup, asking for root access. If you click Grant and you get a success message, you have successfully achieved root on your phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016-01-28-23.57.10.png"><img class="img-responsive"  alt="2016-01-28 23.57.10"   src="/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif"></a></p>
<p>To manage root permissions, open your app drawer and tap the SuperSU icon. You&#8217;ll see a list of apps that have been granted or denied superuser access. You can tap on an app to change its permissions.</p>
<p>If you ever want to unroot, open the SuperSU app, go to its Settings screen, and tap the &#8220;Full unroot&#8221; option. It will attempt to unroot your device. If it works for you, this is definitely the easiest way to unroot your phone.</p>
